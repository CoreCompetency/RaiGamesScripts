/* This strategy will look for a 3.00x cashout and double the bet on every loss.  On a win, it will start over.
   This strategy will quit if 1) it hits 9 losses in a row, or 2) it earns 2000 times the base bet.
   For a base bet of 1, this strategy will run until it wins 2000 mXRB total or loses 511 mXRB in one streak of losses.

   These settings are intended to be used with the customizable script found here:  https://github.com/CoreCompetency/RaiGamesScripts/blob/master/CustomizableBot.js
   Replace the regular betting strategy section with the one in this file.
   Be aware that RaiGames.io is a casino and the expected value of any gambling there is negative:  you are expected to lose money.
   This strategy is not expected to win money.  Run it in test mode before enabling live betting.
